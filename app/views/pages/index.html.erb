                <p>This project was originally intended to not have a front end, but I thought it'd be interesting to add a small dashboard to visualize how it works. </p>
                <p>
                  The project was a simulation of an online merchant database with vendors, items, invoices, customers, and transactions.
                  I built 25+ API endpoints to display information from the database in JSON, and built Active Record + SQL queries to provide a layer of business intelligence.
                  In the dashboard on the next page, I've set up a few AJAX requests to display information about the queries and endpoints in real-time.
                  The AJAX request were intentionally left unoptimized so you're able to view raw time that it takes to make the DB queries.

                  Notes:
                  <br>
                  - Only 2 of the 25 endpoints are displayed in this demo.
                  <br>
                  - All seed file data was generated with the Faker Gem.
